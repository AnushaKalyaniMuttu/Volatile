In Java, the volatile keyword is used to indicate that a variable's value may be changed unexpectedly by multiple threads. When a variable is declared as volatile, the Java Memory Model ensures that changes to that variable are visible to all threads immediately. It doesn't cache the variable's value locally, like it might with non-volatile variables, which helps in multithreaded environments where visibility of changes is crucial
